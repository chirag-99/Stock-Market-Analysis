In this model, deep learning is implemented to train the proposed model using LSTM algorithm. LSTM [Long Short-Term Memory] is an algorithm that makes use of time-series mechanism for analyzing the characteristics, such that it can train the model into an efficient one for further predictions and performance.

LSTM advances the concept of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) by offering memory advantages i.e it provides a feedback mechanism to ensure the security of data. The proposed model is able to intake various fluctuating data values either by manual datasets or via API (Application Programming Interface) and has been tested with various single day values and consecutive day values for prediction. However, the accuracy over time series of two days gave the maximum accuracy. The experimental results thus obtained reveal that the LSTM model proposed by us can efficiently analyze and extract the features of the feeding input and can perform plenty good over any sort of fluctuating data.
